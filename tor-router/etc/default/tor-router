# Tip of the Day: You can create plugins in /etc/tor-router/tr-pre-up.d/ (See example 90-hostname-plugin)

# Allowed destination ports (comma-separated list of port numbers, or service names from /etc/services e.g. http,https,ssh, or ranges, e.g. 0-65535)
# DPORTS=http,https

# Allowed listen ports (comma-separated list of port numbers, or service names from /etc/services e.g. http,https,ssh, or ranges, e.g. 67-68)
# If tor-router is running on an external server, don't forget to allow the ssh port so as not to lock yourself out!
# LPORTS=ssh

# Allow direct access to networks (comma-separated list, use @AUTO to whitelist your local networks)
# If you are using tor-router over an external vpn, add the IP address or CIDR of your VPN server here.
# You can also add your own IP here if tor-router is running on an external server to avoid locking yourself out from that server.
# WHITELIST=@AUTO

# Deny access to networks (comma-separated list, use @AUTO to blacklist unreachable networks)
# If you want to reject access to specific hosts or networks, add the IP address or CIDR here.
# BLACKLIST=@AUTO

# Enable IPv6 when tor-router is running (yes/no, use @AUTO to make this depend on net.ipv6.conf.default.disable_ipv6)
# You can run /usr/share/tor-router/sbin/whatsmyip6 to verify IPv6 routing, but it may fail because not all tor nodes support IPv6.
# In such a case, just run systemctl reload tor-router.service to switch your IP and run /usr/share/tor-router/sbin/whatsmyip6 again.
# ENABLE_IPV6=no

# Prefer IPv6 when tor-router is running (yes/no)
# PREFER_IPV6=no

# Allow routing of traffic from network clients (yes/no, use @AUTO to make this depend on net.ipv4.conf.default.forwarding / net.ipv6.conf.default.forwarding)
# ROUTER=no

# Log new connections to /var/log/tor-router/ (yes/no)
# CONNECTION_LOG=no

# Log rejected connections to /var/log/tor-router/ (yes/no)
# REJECT_LOG=no

# Log iptables rules, ipset rules and sysctl changes to stderr when tor-router starts/stops To view the verbose logs since the last start, 
# run: journalctl -aelq -u tor-router -n 1000 --no-pager _SYSTEMD_INVOCATION_ID="$(systemctl show -p InvocationID --value tor-router)"
# VERBOSE=no

# Tor's VirtualAddrNetworkIPv4 and VirtualAddrNetworkIPv6 (use @AUTO to choose the address automatically)
# VIRTUAL_ADDR4=@AUTO
# VIRTUAL_ADDR6=@AUTO

# Tor-Router SocksPort
# SOCKS_PORT=8050

# Tor-Router TransPort
# TRANS_PORT=8040

# Tor-Router DNSPort
# DNS_PORT=8053

# Exclude nodes with unknown geo IP location (0/1)
# GEOIP_EXCLUDE_UNKNOWN=0

# If STRICT_NODES is set to 1, one of the following *_NODES options is a requirement
# STRICT_NODES=0

# Use specific countries as entry nodes (Example: {ch},{at},{de})
# ENTRY_NODES=

# Use specific countries as exit nodes (Example: {ch},{at},{de})
# EXIT_NODES=

# Exclude nodes in specific countries (Example: {us},{au},{ca},{nz},{gb})
# EXCLUDE_NODES=

# Exclude exit nodes in specific countries (Example: {us},{au},{ca},{nz},{gb})
# EXCLUDE_EXIT_NODES=

# # INTERFACES #
# ##############

# The necessary kernel parameters are configured for the specified interfaces, and the IP addresses 
# are whitelisted ("lo" is always configured/whitelisted). The network interface(s) with a "default" 
# route must be specified here. You can use patterns separated by a comma or semicolon. The default 
# value is "*". You can use INTERFACES=`ip route get 8.8.8.8 | grep -oP 'dev\s+\K\S+'`
# if you only want to configure and whitelist the default interface.

# INTERFACES=*

# You can overwrite kernel parameters for each managed device in /sys/class/net/* 
# when tor-router starts or stops. But only "route_localnet", "forwarding" and 
# "disable_ipv6" can be changed, and only if the key pattern matches. This feature 
# can be used to ensure that, for example, IPv6 is always disabled, or to ensure 
# eth0/wlan0 forwarding, or to prevent tun0 forwarding. An empty or invalid value 
# causes the parameters to remain unchanged. You can use "*=" to prevent any 
# modification. The comment character is "#". Entries are separated by newline 
# characters. In the vast majority of cases, nothing needs to be changed here. 
# Overwriting is only necessary in very specific scenarios.

# If nothing else was configured when tor-router is started, the used values will 
# depend on the variables "ENABLE_IPV6" and "ROUTER", which may in turn depend on 
# "net.*.conf.default.*" if the variables have the value "@AUTO". Transparent 
# routing requires "route_localnet" set to 1 on the network interface(s) with 
# a "default" route. The same applies to any forwarded network interface.

# SYSCTL_UP="
# #net.*.conf.*.route_localnet=1
# #net.*.conf.*.forwarding=0
# #net.*.conf.*.disable_ipv6=1
# "

# If nothing else was configured when tor-router is stopped, default values from 
# "net.*.conf.default.*" will be set on each managed device.

# SYSCTL_DOWN="
# #net.*.conf.*.route_localnet=0
# #net.*.conf.*.forwarding=0
# #net.*.conf.*.disable_ipv6=0
# "

# You can use the following command to see the current values:
# sysctl -a 2>/dev/null | grep -wF -e disable_ipv6 -e forwarding -e route_localnet | sort -k4,4 -k5 -k2,2 -t. | grep --color=always -wF -e 1 -e ''

# You can use the following command to reset (disable) the values:
# sysctl -a 2>/dev/null | grep -wF -e disable_ipv6 -e forwarding -e route_localnet | tr -d ' ' | sed 's/=1/=0/' | sysctl -p /dev/stdin
